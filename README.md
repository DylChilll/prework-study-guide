# My Prework Study Guide

## Description
This study guide shows exactly whhat I have been doing over my time doing this prework. My motivation for creating it was the thought that my friends and family could see what I have been doing. This website solves the problem of me explaining whhat everything is and what I have learned over the prework. I hhave learned how to use HTML, JavaScript, CSS, GitHub and GitBash effectively.

## Installation
Firstly you have to have the correct programs downloaded, you need gitbash and Visual Studio to create a project like this. You will also need a github account which you can get through the github website.

## Usage
My website can be used to view all the things we bootcamp students have learned over the prework. You can also use it to randomly pick which section to learn about, by clicking F12 whilst on the website and click on console, it'll randomly choose one to study.

## Credits
 SkillsForLife - Gave me a lot of the code to use
